# Testing the effect of commercial thinning on stand productivity (ANPP) in LANDIS-II (Biomass Succession)

### General input information

Inputs are based on simulations in the Manawan territory of Quebec for the DIVERSE projet (see https://github.com/Klemet/manawanLANDIS-IIsimulations for more details).

Almost all parameters for Biomass Succession where provided by Yan Boulanger.

Ecoregion 328 was choosen as it corresponds to an ecoregion in the middle of the Manawan territory that is not lowland nor highland and has a relatively gentle slope; it is as neutral as possible for our context.

Simulation is run via a Docker image provided in the main folder.

Initial community text file, initial community raster, ecoregion raster, management area raster and stand rasters were all generated by ScriptToGenerateLandscapeFiles.py.

### Cell Generation
- 10,000 cells were created with random forest composition
  - Each cell contained 2-6 species
  - Random age cohorts were assigned

### Spatial Arrangement
- The 10,000 cells were distributed across two parallel lines
  - Identical cell composition was maintained in both lines

### Treatment Conditions
#### Control Line (Top)
- Cells grew undisturbed throughout the experiment

#### Treatment Line (Bottom)
- Cells underwent commercial thinning at the first timestep
  - Method matched previously demonstrated protocol
- Subsequently left undisturbed

### Additional Parameters
- No inter-cell processes occurred:
  - Dispersal
  - Migration  
  - Seed reproduction

### ANPP Calculation
- Aboveground Net Primary Productivity (ANPP) was calculated separately for:
  - Top line (control)
  - Bottom line (treatment)
- Calculation method:
  1. Summed biomass of all cells in each line
  2. Compared to summed biomass from previous timestep
  
## Result

Commercial thinning does boost the ANPP of the stand, as seen in the figure (the "dip" in values for timestep 5 represents the biomass harvested by the commercial thinning) :
